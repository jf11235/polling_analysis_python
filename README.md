# python-challenge


For this challenge, we are tasked to perform analysis and aggrigations on two data sets, one for a ficticious bank, and one for polling data. The raw data is in the resource folder in each of PyBank and PyPoll. The resulting analysis is in a text document in the analysis folder for each as well.
